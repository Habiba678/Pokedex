# Pokédex

This project is a Pokédex application where Pokémon are displayed in a clean
card-based layout.

Users can browse through the list of Pokémon and open individual cards to view
more detailed information. The interaction is kept simple and easy to understand.

A strong focus was placed on a stable and responsive layout.
The interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes without layout jumps
or unwanted scrolling, providing a consistent experience on desktop, tablet,
and mobile devices.
